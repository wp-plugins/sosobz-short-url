Automatically shortens the blog post URL.

== Description ==

SosoBz Short URL allows you to create shorter URL, just like http://soso.bz/kQrA . 
This plugin creates a short URL from the blog post permalink and stores it in the database. And the URL is displayed below the blog post. 
These Short URLs are particular useful for twitter and alike as these services limit the messages of their users to a certain amount of characters - which leads to the situation that their users are forced to have an eye on what exactly they want to write. 
Also this will help promote your blog. 


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `shorturl` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. When you post a new post, the plugin will automatically generate a short URL.
